# 📊 COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project is a data-driven analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using the [Our World in Data (OWID)](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) dataset. It explores death rates, case trends, and comparative analysis across selected countries including Kenya, USA, Italy, China, and Canada.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and clean a real-world COVID-19 dataset using Python (Pandas).
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on selected countries.
- Visualize death rates and trends over time.
- Handle missing data, date formatting, and apply statistical summaries.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Insights and Reflections

- Death rates varied significantly across countries and over time.
- Some countries (like Italy) had higher fatality rates during earlier waves.
- Data cleaning and handling missing values were crucial to avoid misleading trends.
- Visualizations greatly help in interpreting complex datasets intuitively.
